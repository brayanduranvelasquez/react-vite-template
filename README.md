## Customize Ant Design Theme

If we need to change the default UI of ant design, we can use their [theme editor](https://ant.design/theme-editor). After selecting and changing the UI such as colors, sizes and others, you can export a JSON where you can see the "token" object. That object has to be copy and paste in <i>/src/theme/index</i>. More info [here](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme).
